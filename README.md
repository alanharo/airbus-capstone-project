For the following code to work it is important to maintain the subfolder names (e.g. data/prep_data). Due to the size of the raw data used, we will only include one file which can be used to run the code and analyze it step-by-step. However, keep in mind that the results might vary due to the changes in the input data.

As an additional remark, it is important to run the files in the order mentioned in the prefix of each Jupyter Notebook. Since the notebooks follow a flow, the output of one is the input for the next one.

As a last consideration, the document called `capstone_functions.py` was used to save the functions used and avoid having each notebook with huge blocks defining the functions each time. It is important to import this document correctly for the proper usage of the Notebooks.
